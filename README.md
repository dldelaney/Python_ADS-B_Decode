# Python_ADS-B_Decode
can run either with RTL1090 (pulls from localhost), or from a file of ADS-B messages (one per line), file must be called "ADS-B_HEX.txt"
type 'f' (file) in console for pulling from file (press enter for each new line)
type 'r' (radio) in console for pulling from RTL1090 (this currently just writes to the file, still need to redirect it to the code that parses it)
